# project planning

The main goal of this project is to implement linked list using class/ factory.

I wanted to get some more practice with classes, so I will use classes here

Reading the project description tells us that we would need 2 classes for the follwing

1. LinkedList - represent the full list
2. Node - single element of list containing value property and link to nextNode (by default both are null)
